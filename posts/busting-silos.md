# Busting Data Silos: Asset Management  ❤ Google Data Studio
### By Kevin Sisson

Like most new employees I had so many questions when I started working here at the City of Asheville. One of the first challenges that I faced was figuring out how to answer a common theme at the support desk: “My computer is really slow, when do I get a replacement?!?!?!”

I was told that we replace computers every 4 years, more or less. I could look up one computer at a time on our KACE asset management system to find out the PO number, cost and when we received the older system. However, the data was inconsistent and would not roll up to a report. This question started a year long quest to improve processes (receiving, deployment, maintenance, retirement), break down data silos, clean up data, and find a reporting tool.

Through using beta software, we succeeded! Check out our story here.
