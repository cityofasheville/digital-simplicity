# What a digital organization looks like
### By Eric Jackson

From my title, “Digital Services Architect,” you might think that I’m in charge of making the City of Asheville an effective digital organization. But not only am I not in charge, nobody is. Or everyone is. In a way, that’s part of the point of being digital.

Becoming digital is about organizational transformation, not a bunch of digital tools. Tom Loosemore, the founder of the UK’s Government Digital Service, describes digital as “applying the culture, practices, processes & technologies of the Internet-era to respond to people’s raised expectations” ([@tomskitomisk’s definition of digital](https://twitter.com/tomskitomski/status/729974444794494976?lang=en)).

Understanding just what that means is a journey that we are on together with thousands of other organizations in and out of government. But from time to time someone says or writes something that crystallizes our current understanding. I found that recently in Janet Hughes’ [What a digital organization looks like](https://medium.com/doteveryone/what-a-digital-organisation-looks-like-82426a210ab8).

In future posts we’ll riff on some of the ideas from the article from an Asheville perspective, but I’ll begin by just pointing you to [the article](https://medium.com/doteveryone/what-a-digital-organisation-looks-like-82426a210ab8). It’s worth your time.
