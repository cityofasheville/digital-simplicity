### By Jonathan Feldman

Welcome to our series about what we think won’t work for digital organizations and what will. Inspired by our own experience as well as the great [Medium article](https://medium.com/doteveryone/what-a-digital-organisation-looks-like-82426a210ab8) by [Janet Hughes](https://twitter.com/janethughes), we challenged ourselves to do some deeper thinking about digital fakery vs a deeper adoption of digital transformation principles. We’ll be posting elaborations on these every Friday until we’re done, and invite you to come along for the ride.

Our first elaboration will be next week, but here’s a [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/i/moments/878268741989130240?utm_content=buffer21152&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) to kick it off.
