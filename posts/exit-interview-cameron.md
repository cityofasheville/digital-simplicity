# Exit Interview with Cameron Carlyle
### By Eric Jackson

Cameron Carlyle was an awesome member of our Business & Public Technology team for about three years. A climbing enthusiast, Cameron moved on to rockier pastures in Utah a couple weeks ago, but we wanted to take one last chance to learn from his experience working here. HR conducted a formal exit interview, but we decided to do another one here. We learned a lot. Hope you do as well.
