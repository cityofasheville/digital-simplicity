# Upgrade Alert: Asheville’s Public Safety Radio System
### By Jeff Reble


In 2014 the City of Asheville was faced with a major public safety issue… our ability to communicate with each other and with other agencies. The current Public Safety Radio System was becoming obsolete with many key components reaching their end-of-life cycle. City Council approved a 6 million dollar upgrade to enhance coverage, provide greater reliability, and forge new partnerships across regional public safety agencies.

Three years later and under budget, Asheville’s new Public Safety Radio System is up and running! Asheville’s Fire Chief Scott Brunette describes how the new radio system affects all City residents.
